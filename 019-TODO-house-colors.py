Daily Coding Problem - 2018-10-26.

A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K
different colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that
no two neighboring houses are of the same color.

Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the
cost to build the nth house with kth color, return the minimum cost
which achieves this goal.
